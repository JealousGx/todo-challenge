## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I put into practice the concept of managing the items in the application as well as firebase firestore. Moreover, I also put into practice the ability to make a web app responsive and change the properties at certain points of the responsiveness.

### Continued development

I plan to learn more about React and the concepts and make them more feasible. In addition to this, I also plan on using different technologies in making a fully functional responsive web app.
